# etch-a-sketch
A project implementing Etch-a-Sketch on the browser using JavaScript fundamentals from TOP Foundations course.

The project creates a grid for painting. It has a random colour button, a progressive darkening effect button and an eraser button. Additionally it has a button for creating a new sketch, where the user can input how big he wants the grid to be.
